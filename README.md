# Aurora
Aurora is an addressable LED controller with a graphical interface, audio input, and patterns programmed on an SD card.
It controls up to 8 WS2811-style LED strips in parallel.
A microphone and audio jack can be used for music visualization.
LED patterns are programmed in Lua and can be modified without rebooting by replacing the SD card.
